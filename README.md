# README

Dreamland is a text-based adventure game inspired by both old and new text games.

This is a Ruby on Rails and React app that utilizies a minimal frontend but complex game logic within the Ruby models and controllers. It features user authentication, progress saving, an inventory system, and a 5 quest storyline. 

This game was created for my phase 4 project at Flatiron's Software Engineering Bootcamp.
